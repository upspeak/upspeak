# Upspeak

Upspeak is a knowledge management and information processing system designed for collecting, organizing, and synthesizing data from web sources and your own inputs.

Upspeak aims to lets us build information archives (repositories) that we can systhesize into knowledge graphs. The repositories can also gather data from (or, proxy for us in) places on the web, practically any system accessible over HTTP. It will then let us annotate the data, and (if we want it to) send replies back, all within their contexts.

Upspeak wants to integrate with tools that we already use to consume or create information in multiple (often shared) contexts. e.g., Matrix, Discourse, Fediverse etc.

You may think of Upspeak as:

1. A personal library of self-updating books, each representing an archive of online publications, or happenings of online communities you (may) (want to) participate in.
2. A digital brain that remembers and connects information you encounter online; allowing you to annotate and link information across platforms, creating a personalized web of knowledge.

This document will get clearer as the project develops from a set of thoughts to usable APIs :-)

The current goal is to build out the core of the system and then decide what route to take next.
